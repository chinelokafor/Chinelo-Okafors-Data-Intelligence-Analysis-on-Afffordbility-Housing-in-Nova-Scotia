# Housing Affordability: A Critical Analysis
*A decision intelligence study for understanding the dynamics in Housing availability*

*By: Chinelo Okafor*

## Executive Summary
Housing affordability is a growing concern in Canada with rising home prices, increasing rent burdens and challenging mortgage conditions creating barriers for many individuals and families seeking stable housing. This study utilizes modern data analysis tools including Python, Tableau and various statistical methods to explore housing affordability trends across different Canadian regions. The primary focus will be on factors such as home prices, rent-to-income ratios, vacancy rates and mortgage rates with the goal of providing actionable insights for policymakers, housing developers and stakeholders to address the housing affordability crisis.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Average House Prices** 
<mark>It would be good to put a value statements for each KPI, something that conveys the benefit of looking at average prices, for example:  Understanding trends in housing prices helps identify whether the market is in a period of growth, stability, or decline.  Policymakers can use housing price data to assess the effectiveness of housing policies and make necessary adjustments.</mark>
  – Trends in home prices across various regions and their relationship with local economic factors.
  -	Target: Monitor annual price changes to identify affordability shifts.
  -	Measured quarterly based on regional data from Statistics Canada and other sources.
  
2. **Rent-to-Income Ratio**

<mark>–    <-- be careful of copy-paste from ChatGPT, this character is different than the minus on the keyboard, and doesn't render properly in markdown</mark> The percentage of household income spent on rent, a critical measure of affordability.
- Target: Reduce rent-to-income ratios in major cities.
-	Calculated annually based on available household income and rent data.
  
3. **Vacancy Rates**

– The availability of rental units in different regions, indicating supply-demand dynamics.
- Target: Identify areas with high vacancy rates that could benefit from increased rental development.
- Measured monthly through real estate transaction data.

4. **Mortgage Rates**

- The interest rates impacting homeownership affordability, reflecting broader economic conditions.
- Target: Track the impact of interest rate fluctuations on housing affordability.
- Updated quarterly based on Bank of Canada and mortgage lender rates.

5. **Housing Supply**
   
-  The number of new housing units built annually, assessing the adequacy of the supply to meet growing demand.<mark>Growing demand will be a number you need to get if you are to make sense of this KPI.  You may need to include regional population data</mark>
- Target: Increase the rate of housing construction in high-demand areas.<mark>This isn't a target, it is an action, and you would only do it if housing supply was low relative population.  It would be good to see where housing starts need to be focused..</mark>
- Measured annually through real estate transaction and construction permit data.<mark>I don't think you have this data in your background doc</mark>
