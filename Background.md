# Understanding Housing Affordability: A Critical Analysis
*A Decision intelligence Analysis of Housing Affordability*

## Problem Context
Housing affordability has become one of the most urgent issues in Nova Scotia and many parts of the world, particularly in developed countries (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation [CMHC], 2023; Statistics Canada, 2023). The rising cost of housing, combined with stagnant wages and increasing levels of household debt, has made it increasingly difficult for many individuals and families to access affordable housing. In Canada, for instance, the average price of homes has increased significantly over the last decade, while wages have not kept pace (Bank of Canada, 2023; CMHC, 2023).  

The challenge of housing affordability is exacerbated by various interconnected factors (OECD, 2022). Rapid urbanization has driven demand for housing, particularly in major cities, causing property prices to rise sharply (Statistics Canada, 2023). At the same time, supply shortages, zoning restrictions and high construction costs have limited the availability of affordable housing (CMHC, 2023; Canadian Real Estate Association [CREA], 2023). Additionally, factors such as interest rates, income inequality, and changing demographics further complicate the issue (Bank of Canada, 2023; OECD, 2022).  

This analysis focuses on understanding the factors influencing housing affordability, including market dynamics, housing supply constraints, and socioeconomic disparities. The study will incorporate a range of data sources and methodologies to provide a comprehensive analysis of housing affordability trends in Nova Scotia, particularly in light of ongoing socioeconomic and market changes. Addressing these challenges is crucial, as the housing affordability crisis risks deepening social inequality and limiting economic mobility for many resident of Nova Scotia.

## Significance of the Study
This analysis is important for several reasons:  
1. **Housing Crisis**: Canada faces a significant housing affordability challenge, with home prices increasing faster than household incomes. Understanding regional variations in affordability is crucial because it allows for targeted investment and more informed policy decisions**.  

2. **Economic Impacts**: Housing affordability directly impacts the broader economy, affecting consumer spending, savings, and employment opportunities. The affordability crisis is also linked to social instability and increased poverty rates.  

3. **Government Policies**: While many provincial and municipal governments are working to address housing affordability, this study will not focus on evaluating specific policy effectiveness but rather on analyzing how market trends and socioeconomic factors shape affordability challenges.  

4. **Data-Driven Insights**: Advances in data collection, such as property transaction records and economic indicators, provide an opportunity for more informed policymaking. This study will leverage publicly available datasets on housing prices, income levels and mortgage trends to identify key affordability trends.  

## Research Objectives
This study aims to:
1.	Analyze trends in housing affordability across different regions in Canada, with a focus on key urban centers.
2.	Identify the socioeconomic, market factors influencing housing affordability.
3.	Assess the relationship between housing affordability and other social indicators such as income inequality and population growth.
4.	Develop predictive models to project future housing affordability under various market conditions such as "Develop predictive models to project future housing affordability under various market conditions such as rising mortgage rates, fluctuating housing supply, shifts in rental demands, changes in household income levels etc. 
5.	Provide recommendations for policy makers and stakeholders to improve housing affordability with a focus on long-term solutions that promote both market stability and social equity.
