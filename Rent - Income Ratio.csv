Symbol legend:
A, data quality: excellent




Footnotes:
1,"The universe of this table is restricted to resident buyers who are persons who filed their T1 tax return form in the previous year and purchased a property in a market sale. A market sale refers to an arm's length transaction where all parties act independently with no influence over the other."
2,""Property buyer" refers to a residential property owner that has the property title transferred to, recorded in, registered in or otherwise carried in his name after the sale of a property during the reference period."
3,""Residential property" refers to all land and structures intended for private dwelling purposes, whether on a permanent or a temporary basis. A residential property may have more than one owner."
4,"Buyers in reference period (Y) are owners of the following reference period (Y+1), who purchased a property from January 1st to December 31st of the reference period (Y)."
5,"The Composite Quality Indicator (CQI) shown in this table is created by combining many individual quality indicators, each one representing the quality of different Canadian Housing Statistics Program (CHSP) data processing steps (for example: coding, geocoding, linkage and imputation) and includes the following values: A - Excellent: All domain variables and the variable of interest are of excellent quality. B - Very good: All domain variables and the variable of interest are of very good to excellent quality. C - Good: The quality of some of the domain variables or the variable of interest is considered good while all the other variables are of very good to excellent quality. D - Acceptable: The quality of some of the domain variables or the variable of interest is considered acceptable while all the other variables are of good to excellent quality. E - Use with caution: Several domain variables or the variable of interest are of poor quality. F - Too unreliable to be published. The CQIs are available starting with the reference period of 2019."
6,"Previous reference period estimates are subject to revision."
7,"The geographic boundaries used in this table are the 2016 census subdivisions boundaries."
8,""Number of buyers as part of a property sale" refers to either a single property buyer or group of property buyers, measured as a count, that are registered on the title of the property sold."
9,""Immigrant status" refers to whether the owner is a non-immigrant or an immigrant. Non-immigrant or Canadian-born owners include persons who landed in Canada (for immigration purposes) prior to 1952 (the maximum period for which immigration status can be determined from the database)."
10,""Period of immigration" refers to the period in which the immigrant first obtained landed immigrants or permanent resident status."
11,""Admission category" refers to the name of the immigration program or group of programs under which an immigrant has been granted for the first time the right to live in Canada permanently by immigration authorities. Admission category is only provided for immigrant owners."
12,"Families are comprised of: 1) couples (married or common-law, including same-sex couples) living in the same dwelling with or without children, and 2) lone-parents (male or female) living with one or more children. Persons who are not matched to a family become persons not in census families. They may be living alone, with a family to whom they are related, with a family to whom they are unrelated or with other persons not in census families."
13,"Counts undergo random rounding, a process that transforms all raw counts into randomly rounded counts. This reduces the possibility of identifying property owners in the tabulations. All percentages are derived from rounded counts, subtotals and totals may not exactly equal the sum of components due to system rounding."
14,"Averages and medians are calculated using values greater than zero for the variables of interest."
15,""Sale price" refers to the monetary value of a transaction where goods or services were sold."
16,""Price-to-income ratio" refers to the ratio between the sale price of the property sold and the sum of the total individual incomes of the property buyers."
17,""First-time home buyer" refers to a person who purchased a residential property during the reference period and did not own a residential property previously. It includes buyers who claimed the home buyers' amount and buyers whose spouse or common-law partner was a buyer in the same sale, and who claimed the amount."
18,""Immigrant" refers to a person who is, or who has ever been, a landed immigrant or permanent resident. Such a person has been granted the right to live in Canada permanently by immigration authorities. Immigrants who have obtained Canadian citizenship by naturalization are included in this group."
